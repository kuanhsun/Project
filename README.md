## Project: Bird Species Classifier
This project aims to classify two bird species 'Psilopogon nuchalis' and 'Pycnonotus sinensis' accurately, with which is based on the images I provided. Due to low level devices, the file posted on GitHub can only demonstrated a dataset size of 311. However, this project is designed to contain considerable images and therefore database and cluster method is applied to tackle with situations of large sample size.

# Database
We expect to introduce two databases into this project. MongoDB is implemented owing to its outstanding extendability and we store images and labels here. MySQL is planned to be used to collect metadata from images thereselves; however, I did not put it in use since the image data itself is the core I want to process.

# Method
