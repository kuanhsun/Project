# Project
This project aims to classify two bird species 'Psilopogon nuchalis' and 'Pycnonotus sinensis' accurately, with which is based on the images I provided. Due to low level devices, the file posted on GitHub can only demonstrated a dataset size of 311. However, this project is designed to contain considerable images and therefore database and cluster method is applied to tackle with situations of large sample size.
